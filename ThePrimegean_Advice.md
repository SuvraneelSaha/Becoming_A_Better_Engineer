If I could give advice to myself when starting as a software engineer - ThePrimegean

the thing is that we all are bound by one own mindset
and whennever - we face anything in our day to day life our mindset takes over
its through rigorous process of cleansing unlearning and learning new habits and goind over the actions that
people can learn and adopt new mindset

so in terms of engineering or in life -
i feel that i too have a mindset of avoiding things or tasks which are difficult and which are more of friction
i completely stop doing it cause i perceive that these are not the right things , which in fact is just the opposite

thats the problem - continuously perceiving the things which are difficult and of more friction as wrong or not the right thing to do

the SOl : Need to experience and expand the horizon of ways in which a problem gets solved and in this way only
we could gain the solution to many different problem

also we need to expand the horizon of knowledge so that we can do the things which seem to us that are difficult or of more friction
but eventually these are the things which will give highest returns over the period of time

What you fear and avoid , will come back and bite you in the ass .
What you fear , and avoid is the only thing that will give you massive success
Even if you fear practice more and more of what you fear ,
do the work scared . But Do
Just DO IT !!
